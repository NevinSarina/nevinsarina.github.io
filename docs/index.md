Recent Climate Change Incidents 2020

Answer: Climate change has made extreme weather events more likely, and when they happen, stronger.

Another factor flooding is exacerbated by increases in paved surfaces, because water can't be absorbed by open soil. Many cities in China have grown rapidly and have never seen this kind of rainfall, and don't have any flood control infrastructure underground. So when these climate fueled floods happened, they were even more destructive. Water rapidly filled subway and road tunnels and many people were killed in flooded subways.

There is also quite a bit of significant flooding in a more-destructive-than-usual [Indian monsoon season.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/world/asia/india-landslides-floods.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)

Meanwhile, substantial portions of the [western US and Canada, and also Siberia, are seeing record high temps and wildfires](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/01/27/peat-fires-smolder-in-siberia-despite-bone-chilling-temperatures-a72747). Siberian wildfires are especially concerning because of the peat bogs, which can burn for years, are very hard to put out, and have truly enormous amounts of CO2 absorbed in them which will be released into the atmosphere if they burn.

The [fires in Canada have been large enough to generate their own weather,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/23/us-wildfires-weather-systems-fire-tornado-haze-clouds) including lightning, which then sparks and expands the fires. This Guardian article has some info on firestorms.

Recent Projections

[Who projections from 2018](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health)

>Between **2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress.**

[Projections referenced from a report by CNN in 2019](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/16/health/climate-change-health-emergency-study/index.html)

>Due to climate change-related food shortages alone, the world could see a net increase of 529,000 adult deaths by 2050, the report said. Climate change could force 100 million people into extreme poverty by 2030 and poverty makes people more vulnerable to health problem

[Cornell Climate Refugee projections from 2017](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2017/06/rising-seas-could-result-2-billion-refugees-2100)

>**By 2060, about 1.4 billion people could be climate change refugees**, according to the paper. Geisler extrapolated that number to 2 billion by 2100.

**This part has me more worried though!**

[**A Security Threat Assessment of Global Climate Change**](https://climateandsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/a-security-threat-assessment-of-climate-change.pdf)

- How Likely Warming Scenarios Indicate A Catastrophic Security Change

>At (1-2°C) 1.8-3.6°F of global average warming, the world is very likely to experience more intense and frequent climate shocks that could swiftly destabilize areas already vulnerable to insecurity, conflict, and human displacement, as well as those regions whose stability is brittle due to underlying geographic and natural resource vulnerabilities.

- **(1.5°C) 2.7° F above Pre-Industrial Levels could occur by 2030**

Under this scenario, all regions will experience high levels of climate security threats that will disrupt key security environments, institutions, and infrastructure. **The resulting resource scarcity, population migration, and social and political disasters are likely to interact at the international level, alongside the creation of new areas of great power competition and potential conflict**

The current 2050 projections in summary --> 

At (2-4+°C/3.6-7.2+°F) of global average warming

>the world is very likely to experience significant insecurity and destabilization at the local, national, regional, and international levels.

>All regions will be exposed to potentially catastrophic levels of climate security threats, the 
consequences of which could lead to a breakdown of security and civilian infrastructure, economic and 
resource stability, and political institutions at a large scale.
